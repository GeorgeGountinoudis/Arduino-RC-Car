# DIY Arduino car
A car model based on Arduino UNO. A project made for Ubiquitous Computing class in University of Thessaly.
From the moment the components came, due to start of Covid 19 the items had a great delay of 3-4 months, it took me around 3 days with little daily effort to complete it, that means if someone is planning to make a simmilar project I believe it would take less than a day to complete the base and the functional part of the project.
The project of course can be stylished and build on a different base, that's personal preference, I chose to complete the base of it so it can be functioning due to the presentation deadline being around the corner. The code worked perfectly and the project was completed with no flaws.
Feel free to propose changes and commit your ideas, if anyone has questions please contact me anytime.
