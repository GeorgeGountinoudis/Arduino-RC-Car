# Arduino-Remote-Controlled-Car
A car model based on Arduino UNO. A project made for Ubiquitous Computing class in my university.
From the moment the components came it took me around 3 days with little effort to complete it, meaning if someone is planning to make a simmilar project I believe it would take less than a day to complete it with full effort.
Feel free to propose changes and commit your ideas, if anyone has questions dm me anytime.
