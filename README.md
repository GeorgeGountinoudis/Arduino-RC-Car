# Arduino based RC Car
A car model based on Arduino UNO. A project made for Ubiquitous Computing class in University of Thessaly.

From the moment the components came, due to start of Covid 19 the items had a great delay of 3-4 months, it took me around a week with little daily effort to complete the project, that means if someone is planning to make a simmilar creation I believe it would take less than a couple of days to complete the base and the functional part of the project. The car of course can be amplified and built on a different base, that's personal preference, I chose to complete the functioning part of it so it can presented in the up coming deadline. The code worked perfectly and the project was completed with no flaws.

Feel free to propose changes and commit your ideas, if anyone has questions please contact me anytime.
